# Screens

Screens is a Android utility that allows you to quickly enter splitscreen mode with pre selected apps. It creates shortcuts that can be opened from any launcher. This might be good for productivity or loading SeriesGuide and Kore at the same time.

The name and logo are based upon the Screen and Tmux utlitys however functionality is closer to Tmuxinator.
